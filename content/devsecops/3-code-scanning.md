# 3. Fix unsafe direct startup

Budget: 17 minutes. The shelter API passes its tests but starts with debugging enabled when `app.py` is run directly.

## Why it matters

CodeQL's `py/flask-debug` rule identifies a configuration that can expose the Werkzeug debugger. A regression test makes the intended startup behavior explicit. This small fix does not turn Flask's development server into a production server.

## Try it

1. Inspect the baseline **Flask app is run in debug mode** finding and its path, `app/server/app.py`. Confirm that the source ends with `app.run(debug=True, port=5100)`. If the finding is absent or the code differs, use [troubleshooting](take-home/troubleshooting.md) before changing anything.
2. In the same Codespaces terminal, inspect your work before switching:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   git switch exercise/shelter-change
   ```

   Start with a clean tree or preserve existing edits on their intended branch first. In the editor, open `app/server/app.py` and change only the final call:

   ```python
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=False, port=5100) # Port 5100 to avoid macOS conflicts
   ```

3. In `app/server/test_app.py`, add the following method inside `class TestApp`, before `if __name__ == '__main__':`. Keep its four-space indentation. Open the bundled workshop's `content/devsecops/solutions/startup-test.py.txt` in the Codespaces editor to copy the [test snippet](solutions/startup-test.py.txt).

   ```python
       def test_direct_startup_disables_debug(self):
           import os
           from pathlib import Path
           import runpy

           with patch.dict(os.environ, {'DATABASE_PATH': ':memory:', 'FLASK_DEBUG': '1'}):
               with patch('flask.Flask.run') as run:
                   runpy.run_path(str(Path(__file__).with_name('app.py')), run_name='__main__')

           run.assert_called_once_with(debug=False, port=5100)
   ```

4. Save both files in the editor, then commit and push from the learner root. Do not create a new PR or commit these edits to `main`:

   ```bash
   git add -- app/server/app.py app/server/test_app.py
   git diff --cached
   git commit -m "Disable direct debug startup and test the default"
   git push
   ```

5. On GitHub.com, confirm CI and CodeQL started for the updated PR. Do not install dependencies or run these tests in the codespace. Continue to dependencies while Actions runs; check back at the start of Lab 4, during Lab 5, and in Lab 6 before merging.

If Codespaces is unavailable, the [local Git fallback](0-setup.md#fallback-a-local-vs-code-and-git) uses the same commands. The [file-editor fallback](0-setup.md#fallback-b-github-file-editor) applies the same two edits on `exercise/shelter-change`; evaluate the last commit containing both changes.

The test intercepts `Flask.run`, so it never opens a socket. It uses an in-memory database and deliberately sets `FLASK_DEBUG=1` to check that the explicit safe default takes precedence. Do not edit `app/scripts/common.sh`: its debug setting is for local development. You can also use the Flask CLI for deliberate local debugging. Neither route is a production deployment recipe.

## Checkpoint

Record the final fix commit and its successful functional checks. Inspect the PR's CodeQL results for that revision and confirm the targeted finding no longer appears. The default-branch alert may remain open while your PR is unmerged; take-home Lab 1 checks its closure after merge.

The supplied regression test fails against `debug=True` and passes against `debug=False`. You still need the GitHub results above. See [solutions](solutions/README.md) for the explanation, and leave your working PR open.
